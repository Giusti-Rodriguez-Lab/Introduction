What do we do?
Our lab, along with the PGC and the LAGC, strives to contribute to the genetic understanding of psychiatric disorders through the study of marginalized communities, in particular Latin Americans, through the practice of techniques such as Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and DNA methylation assays
